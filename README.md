In this repository you will find a python notebook having code for the flappy bird game and two images of bird and pipe used in flappy bird game.
In the upcoming repositories you will see how I am going to apply Reinforcement learning in the Flappy bird game , so that model will become able to learn how to play flappy bird game and then it will play on its own.
